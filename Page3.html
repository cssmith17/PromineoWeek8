    never being invented in the series' timeline, everything has a sort of halcyon feel to it. During the middle of the 21st century, the <br>
    superpowers of the world begin to run out of fossil fuels, and some wage war or invade to secure more. It's unknown who fires first, <br>
    but on October 23rd, 2077, all of the great superpowers unleash their arsenal of nuclear weapons on each other. Referred to as, the <br>
    Great War, This event wipes out much of Earth's population and only the few humans secured in Vaults built around the country survive <br>
    the worst of the initial death and destruction.</li>

    with delivering a Platinum poker chip to Mr. House, the man responsible for protecting Las Vegas from nuclear destruction. Before the <br>
    game starts, the Courier is taken prisoner and shot in the head by a strange man, who steals his chip. Miraculously surviving the <br>
    incident, the Courier sets out to find this man, recover the Platinum Chip, and on the way become embroiled with a conflict between <br>
    two major factions vying for control of the Hoover Dam.</li>
