    <li>Ghost of Tsushima is a fictional story based on the very real attempted conquering of Japan by the Mongol empire in the 13th century.
    </li>
        <li>The story revolves around Jin Sakai, of clan Sakai, as one of the last remaining samurai on Tsushima island attempting to <br>
            protect and save his island from the invading Mongol horde. Grappling with his his concepts of honor and discipline a samurai, 
            <br> Jin is forced to employ guerilla warfare and recruit all that he can to save his people.
        </li>
        <li>Despite the names, clans, and story of the game being entirely fiction, this game does a wonderful job of putting you in the <br>
            position of a 13th century samurai defending Japan and their shogun from an invading enemy. The game is also both visually and <br>
            audibly beautiful, borrowing many tropes from director Akira Kurosawa and the comic book series Usagi Yojimbo.
